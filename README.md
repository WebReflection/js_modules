js_modules
==========

a list of agnostic JavaScript modules compatible with CommonJS and [require_client](https://github.com/WebReflection/require_client) ... as simple as that.

Feel free to push your client JS module too providing a test that demonstrates the module works.
If you don't want to setup anything and just write a test, have a look at [wru](https://github.com/WebReflection/wru).
